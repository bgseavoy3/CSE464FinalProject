Project Part 3:
Refractors done:
Extract Method - I had constatly reused code that stored characters from my parsed lines in an array list, I changed this to a method callend findWords
Extract Method - I also had resued code for reading new lines, which I changed to a seperate new method called readALine

Continous integration - as I did not have this set up for the last project, I set it up for this one, I will add screenshots for that along with expected outputs below
